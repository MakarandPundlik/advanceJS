### Function and expressions and First Class functions 

1. function expression is when an anonymous function is assigned to a variable 
2. function declaration AKA function statement is when function is just declared using keyword function
3. the key difference between function statement and function expression is hoisting, function declared with function statament will be called even if call is written the actual definition. On the other hand, function expression will throw error if function is called before definition 
4. anonymous function is just a part of function expression where a varibale is assigned with a function that has no name (special case of function statement)
5. Values passed while calling the function is known as arguements and when these values are accessed within the function these are called as parameters. Parameters have local scope with that function except for the object and data structures.
6. ability of a function to be passed to another function as an argument or ability of a function to return a function is known as first class functions.
Pro tip:- callbacks are first class functions
